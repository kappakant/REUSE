-------------------------- MODULE SharedVariables --------------------------
CONSTANT RMs
\* Not really a variable. Kind of a misnomer, but I suppose RMs is a parameter in real use?

\* So I'm getting syntax errors from shared names, which I understand.
\* There's probably a better way to do things, but for now I'll just force encode synchronization.
